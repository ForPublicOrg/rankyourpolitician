// On-demand cache invalidation, called by the data manager after a successful
// `dm publish`. Pages carry time-based revalidate only as a self-heal safety
// net (86400 on the hub pages, 604800 on the ~10.6k-page long tail - the daily
// window there was most of the ISR-writes bill), so without this a Firestore
// publish could take up to a week to appear; with it, every page regenerates
// on its next visit. The whole layout is swept because published collections
// (politicians, central/state government, office seats) feed nearly every
// route, and a sweep only marks entries stale - Vercel bills an ISR write per
// page actually visited afterwards, not per page invalidated.
//
// Note: a page that regenerates within ~30 min of a publish can still bake the
// previous in-process TTL snapshot (lib/data.ts memos); `dm publish` prints a
// reminder to run `dm revalidate` again ~35 min later to re-sweep those, and
// the weekly revalidate remains the backstop. See README "How data flows".
